## Description

This project is an e-commerce application developed as part of a React course. The application is designed to provide an online platform where users can explore, select, and purchase musical instruments and accessories.

Product Details: Each instrument has a detail page with complete information, including name, description, price, and stock availability.
Add to Cart: Users can select the desired quantity of a product and add it to the shopping cart.
Shopping Cart: The cart displays selected items, allows quantity adjustments, and updates the total.
Checkout: Users can proceed to the "Complete Purchase" page to review the cart and finalize the purchase.
Stock Management: The application manages real-time stock availability, disabling the purchase button when the product is out of stock.
Responsive Design: The application is designed to adapt to different devices, providing an optimal user experience on mobile and desktop.
